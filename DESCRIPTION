Title: Piecewise constant estimation of the hazard function for time-to-event data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Olivier Bouaziz
Maintainer: Olivier Bouaziz <olivier.bouaziz@parisdescartes.fr>
Description: Given right censored data, the package estimates the hazard function using a piecewise-constant
 hazard model. The method is combined with the adaptive-ridge algorithm which allows to automatically choose the cuts 
 from a given grid of cuts.
